GUI-for-Shapes-Calculations-Formula is a Java-based application utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to calculate geometric properties of various shapes. The system features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input dimensions and compute areas, perimeters, volumes, and other shape-specific formulas. With modular design leveraging classes for each shape and polymorphism for flexible calculations, it is an ideal tool for educational and practical applications.
